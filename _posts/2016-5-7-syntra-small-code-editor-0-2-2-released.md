## Release Notes

- Name change from Small to Syntra Small (small is now part of the syntra.io project)
- Added the option to hide/show the 80 character ruler [ Command + R ]
- Added the option to hide/show code indentation guides [ Command + Shift + I ]
- The Undo/Redo menu items now work (undo and redo was working via hotkeys, but not the menu items)
- A bug has been fixed that was causing the language to revert back to the auto-detected language upon saving the file, even when a custom language was selected (bug report: https://help.mediachicken.com/topic/saving-file-resets-syntax-highlighting-colors)
